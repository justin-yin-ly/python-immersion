# E1.1 | Getting Started With Python
For the first exercise, I've created a simple python script, add.py, which asks the user to input two numbers and then prints out the sum. 
I've also included the file requirements.txt, which details the project's dependencies. Below you can find screenshots of each of the steps in this exercise.
