# E1.4 | File Handling in Python
This task had me working with operations relating to manipulating files using Python. I reused code from the previous exercise where applicable, namely the difficulty calculation, recipe input, and recipe print out. New additions include functionality for asking a user what file they would like to open/create in order to input data through the code written in the recipe_input.py script. recipe_search.py compliments this by allowing users to search for a specified file name to open for reading. Users are then presented with a list of ingredients from the file and asked which ingredient they would like to search for. Upon receiving a valid input, the script will look through the recipes it can find from the file and print out recipes that include the ingredient they specified.
