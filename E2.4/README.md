# E2.4 | Django Views and Templates
In this exercise, I made use of Django's system of Views and Templates to create my own custom welcome page for the user to see, instead of the default Django welcome page. After creating a basic HTML file to work with, I hooked up the template to the appropriate view and mapped the URL accordingly in the app's urls.py file, as well as registered it in the main project directory's urls.py file. As of time of writing, the HTML page is completely bare bones, serving only to prove that I got the custom template working. I expect this will change within the next few exercises.
