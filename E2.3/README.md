# E2.3 | Django Models
For this exercise, I've created [another repository](https://github.com/justin-yin-ly/recipe-app) that will host the recipe app as I develop it with Django across this achievement. I got started with defining the models and running a few test cases as per this task's instructions. Below I've included the necessary screenshots showing the progress I've made with getting the app running.
