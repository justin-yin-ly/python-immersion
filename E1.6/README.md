# E1.6 | Databases in Python
This task involved working with MySQL to create and manage a database through python scripts. After installing MySQL and connecting my script to it, I added the logic seen in previous exercises, along with the new functions needed for this task, such as being able to DELETE and UPDATE recipes. In my images, I've included a few snippets of the helper functions I used in my script alongside the expected task images.
