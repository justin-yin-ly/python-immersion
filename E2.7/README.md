# E2.7 | Data Analyis and Visualization in Django
In this exercise, I added functionality that allows the user to search through the database as well as data visualization for the recipes that exist. When the user fills out the search form and presses the search button, the page will generate a chart based on the data the search returned. I also wrote a few new tests in order to gauge the cohesiveness of some of the new features.
