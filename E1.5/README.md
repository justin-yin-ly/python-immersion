# E1.5 | Object-Oriented Programming In Python
In this exercise, I created a custom class for handling recipe creation that utilizes concepts covered in the text material, such as getter methods and operator overloading. As with previous iterations of this application, it is capable of taking in custom recipes and displaying them back to the user. Following this task's instructions, the recipes this time have been hard coded.
