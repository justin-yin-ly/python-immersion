# E2.5 | Django MVT Revisited
Throughout this exercise, I spent quite a bit of time prettying up the site to be more presentable and adding functionalty for navigating between the various pages. I've also incorporated the material covered, such as adding and displaying images, making different views for the full list and details page, and adding clickable links and buttons. The buttons weren't necessarily part of the task instructions, but I thought it prudent to add such a feature.

## Task Images
