# E1.7 | Object-Relational Mapping in Python
For this task, I installed necessary applications and python packages to run my own SQL server and work with it through my scripts. Using the new object-relational manager, I recreated the recipe app with a few new additions, namely the ability to easily see all recipes, and an adjustment to the search function that allows users to search by more than one ingredient if so desired. It appears that there may be some parts of my code that are technically legacy code, but it doesn't appear to have affected functionality for now.
