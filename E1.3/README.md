# E1.3 | Operators & Functions in Python
This exercise involved creating my own functions that made use of comparison operators, as well as familiarizing myself with how loops worked in Python.
The `take_recipe()` function asks for input from the user: a recipe name, a cooking time in minutes, and an ingredients list. It then assembles this data into a dictionary and appends it to a list of recipes. This recipe list is then iterated through with a for loop to print the information out for the user to see, rating the recipe's difficulty using a handful of conditions.
After all the recipes are displayed, all the ingedients across the different recipes are also displayed.
