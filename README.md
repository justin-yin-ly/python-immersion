# CareerFoundry Python Immersion

This is Justin Ly's github repository for all exercises related to CareerFoundry's Python Immersion course. Exercises are broken up into separate folders for now, until a particular Achievement may require its own dedicated folder for ease of use.

I will be attempting to keep up with a learning journal to the best of my abilities as I progress through this course. This journal can be found here:
