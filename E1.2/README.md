# E1.2 | Data Types in Python
In this exercise, I got used to the various data types within Python and learned how to create and manipulate various data structures.
For each recipe, I decided to use a Dictionary for containing recipe data. I determined that since we would be working with multiple instances of similar data that depend on specified keys, a Dictionary would make the most sense. The key-value pair structure makes the data more legible than just throwing everything together in a list and having to guess which index pointed to which part of the recipe.
Additionally, for containing all the recipes together, I used a list since the structure for this aspect needed to be simpler, and if I needed to add more data later I could do so more easily than with a tuple.
